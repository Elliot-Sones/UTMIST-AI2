# TensorBoard Import Error - FIXED âœ…

## Problem

You were getting this error when starting training:
```
ImportError: Trying to log data to tensorboard but tensorboard is not installed.
```

## Solution

**TensorBoard is now optional!** The training script has been updated to:
- âœ… Check if TensorBoard is installed
- âœ… Disable TensorBoard logging if not available
- âœ… Continue training normally with console logging only
- âœ… Show TensorBoard status in configuration output

## What Changed

### Before:
- Training would crash if TensorBoard wasn't installed
- TensorBoard was required dependency

### After:
- Training works with or without TensorBoard
- Console logging still provides all the info you need
- TensorBoard is purely optional for visualization

## Running Training Now

Just run:
```bash
python user/train_with_strategy_encoder.py
```

The training will:
1. Check if TensorBoard is available
2. If yes: use it for additional visualization
3. If no: skip it and continue with console logging
4. Either way: **you get full console logging with all metrics!**

## Installing TensorBoard (Optional)

If you want TensorBoard visualizations, install it:
```bash
pip install tensorboard
```

Then you can view training curves:
```bash
tensorboard --logdir checkpoints/strategy_encoder_training/tb_logs
```

## Training Output

You'll now see:
```
======================================================================
TRAINING CONFIGURATION
======================================================================
Total timesteps: 5,000,000
Learning rate: 8e-5 â†’ 2e-5 (linear decay)
...
Device: mps
TensorBoard: Disabled (not installed - install with: pip install tensorboard)
======================================================================
```

Or if TensorBoard is installed:
```
TensorBoard: Enabled (checkpoints/strategy_encoder_training/tb_logs)
```

## Console Logging Still Works!

Even without TensorBoard, you get **comprehensive console logging**:

```
Timestep     Rollout  Reward       Win%     Dmg+/-          FPS        Time
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4,096        1        -15.23       0.0      -8.2(8.3/16.5)  487        00:00:08
8,192        2        -12.45       5.0      -5.1(12.4/17.5) 512        00:00:16
```

This is all you need to monitor training! TensorBoard is just a nice-to-have for pretty graphs.

## Summary

âœ… **Fixed**: Training no longer requires TensorBoard
âœ… **Working**: Console logging provides all metrics
âœ… **Optional**: Install TensorBoard if you want visualizations

**You're ready to train!** ðŸš€
