# All Fixes Applied to Your Training

## üêõ **CRITICAL BUGS FIXED**

### 1. **VecNormalize Clipping Win Rewards** ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê MOST IMPORTANT
**Location**: [train_simplified_OPTIMIZED.py:513](user/train_simplified_OPTIMIZED.py#L513)

**Problem**:
```python
clip_reward=10.0  # ‚ùå WRONG!
```
- Your win reward = 100
- VecNormalize clips it to 10
- Model thinks: "winning = dealing 140 damage"
- **This completely breaks the learning objective!**

**Fixed**:
```python
clip_reward=150.0  # ‚úì Now win rewards pass through!
```

**Impact**: This was probably THE reason your model wasn't learning to win.

### 2. **SimpleSelfPlayHandler Missing get_env_info()** ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
**Location**: [train_simplified_OPTIMIZED.py:439-443](user/train_simplified_OPTIMIZED.py#L439-L443)

**Problem**:
```python
if not zips:
    return ConstantAgent()  # ‚ùå No action_space!
```

**Fixed**:
```python
if not zips:
    opponent = ConstantAgent()
    if self.env:
        opponent.get_env_info(self.env)  # ‚úì Initialize!
    return opponent
```

**Impact**: Training crashed immediately with AttributeError

---

### 3. **Damage Reward Always Zero** ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
**Location**: [train_simplified_OPTIMIZED.py:334](user/train_simplified_OPTIMIZED.py#L334)

**Problem**:
```python
return (delta_dealt - delta_dealt) / 140  # ‚ùå Always 0!
```

**Fixed**:
```python
return (delta_dealt - delta_taken) / 140  # ‚úì Actual reward!
```

**Impact**: Model had NO reward signal for damage trading

---

### 4. **No Normalization Initialization** ‚≠ê‚≠ê
**Location**: [train_simplified_OPTIMIZED.py:545-555](user/train_simplified_OPTIMIZED.py#L545-L555)

**Problem**:
- VecNormalize starts with mean=0, std=1
- First few episodes have wildly wrong normalization
- Causes unstable early training

**Fixed**:
```python
# Warm up normalization with 1000 random steps
for _ in range(1000):
    random_actions = ...
    vec_env.step(random_actions)
```

**Impact**: More stable training from the start

---

## üéØ **HYPERPARAMETER IMPROVEMENTS**

### 5. **Self-Play Curriculum** ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
**Location**: [train_simplified_OPTIMIZED.py:222-226](user/train_simplified_OPTIMIZED.py#L222-L226)

**Problem**:
- Self-play from start = two terrible agents learning nothing
- Wastes 40% of training

**Fixed**:
```python
"self_play_weight": 0.0,  # Start at 0%
"self_play_enable_winrate": 0.50,  # Only enable after 50% WR
"self_play_warmup_steps": 200_000,  # And after 200k steps
"self_play_max_weight": 0.50,  # Then gradually increase to 50%
```

**Impact**: Learn fundamentals first, THEN play against self

---

### 6. **Entropy Coefficient** ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
**Original**: `ent_coef = 0.005` (decays to 0.0005)
**Fixed**: `ent_coef = 0.02` (decays to 0.005)

**Why**: 4x more exploration, model won't collapse to first strategy

---

### 7. **Win Reward Dominance** ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
**Original**: Win = ¬±30
**Fixed**: Win = ¬±100

**Why**: Must be 3-5x larger than accumulated damage rewards

---

### 8. **Policy Update Constraints** ‚≠ê‚≠ê
**Original**:
- `target_kl = 0.015` (very restrictive)
- `clip_range_final = 0.05` (very conservative)
- `max_grad_norm = 0.5` (small gradients)

**Fixed**:
- `target_kl = 0.035` (2.3x more flexible)
- `clip_range_final = 0.1` (2x larger)
- `max_grad_norm = 1.5` (3x larger gradients)

**Why**: Allow meaningful policy updates, escape local minima

---

### 9. **Network Depth** ‚≠ê‚≠ê
**Original**: 3 residual blocks
**Fixed**: 5 residual blocks (with expansion=3)

**Why**: Richer feature representations

---

### 10. **Batch Size** ‚≠ê
**Original**: 512
**Fixed**: 1024

**Why**: More stable gradient estimates

---

### 11. **Orthogonal Initialization** ‚≠ê
**Original**: `ortho_init = False`
**Fixed**: `ortho_init = True`

**Why**: Better gradient flow, proven to help in RL

---

### 12. **Observation Clipping** ‚≠ê
**Original**: `clip_obs = 5.0`
**Fixed**: `clip_obs = 10.0`

**Why**: Don't clip important observation features

---

## üìä **NEW FEATURES ADDED**

### 13. **Distance Control Reward** ‚≠ê‚≠ê
**Location**: [train_simplified_OPTIMIZED.py:347-375](user/train_simplified_OPTIMIZED.py#L347-L375)

Rewards strategic positioning (staying at optimal fighting distance 2-4 units)

---

### 14. **Dynamic Self-Play Scheduler** ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
**Location**: [train_simplified_OPTIMIZED.py:689-733](user/train_simplified_OPTIMIZED.py#L689-L733)

Automatically enables self-play when model is ready:
- Monitors overall win rate
- Waits for 200k steps minimum
- Requires 50%+ win rate
- Gradually increases weight based on performance

---

### 15. **Comprehensive Debugging Script** ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
**File**: [user/debug_training.py](user/debug_training.py)

Tests 8 critical systems before training:
1. Observation space sanity
2. Action space & control
3. Reward signal quality
4. Environment determinism
5. Value function gradient flow
6. Opponent difficulty
7. Network architecture
8. Reward component breakdown

**Run before every training session!**

## üéØ **DEBUGGING GUIDE CREATED**

### 16. **Comprehensive Troubleshooting** ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
**File**: [WHY_NOT_LEARNING.md](WHY_NOT_LEARNING.md)

Covers 20 reasons why RL models fail:
- Environment issues (5 causes)
- Reward signal issues (5 causes)
- Network architecture issues (5 causes)

## üìà **EXPECTED IMPROVEMENTS**

### Before Fixes (Your Current Results):
```
Step 60k:
- Win rates: 0% or 100% (deterministic)
- Entropy: Near 0 (no exploration)
- Reward: Decreasing over time
- Explained variance: Negative
‚ùå Model is STUCK
```

### After Fixes (Expected):
```
Step 60k:
- Win rates: 40-65% (appropriate variance)
- Entropy: -0.3 to -0.4 (still exploring)
- Reward: Increasing steadily
- Explained variance: >0.6

Step 200k:
- Win rates: 60-75%
- Entropy: -0.2 to -0.3
- Reward: +8 to +10
- Self-play: Starting to kick in

Step 500k:
- Win rates: 70-85%+
- Entropy: -0.1 to -0.2
- Reward: +10 to +15
- Self-play: At 30-40%
‚úì Model is LEARNING
```

---

## üöÄ **HOW TO USE**

### Step 1: Run Debugger
```bash
python user/debug_training.py
```

Review ALL warnings. Fix any ‚ùå errors before training.

### Step 2: Train with Optimized Script
```bash
python user/train_simplified_OPTIMIZED.py
```

### Step 3: Monitor Key Metrics

Watch tensorboard:
```bash
tensorboard --logdir checkpoints/simplified_training_OPTIMIZED/tb_logs
```

**Critical metrics** (check every eval at 20k step intervals):
- ‚úÖ Entropy loss < -0.15 (still exploring)
- ‚úÖ Explained variance > 0.5 (value function works)
- ‚úÖ Episode reward increasing
- ‚úÖ Win rates gradually improving (not stuck at 0%/100%)

### Step 4: Intervene if Needed

**If at 100k steps:**
- Entropy < -0.05: Increase `ent_coef` to 0.03
- Explained variance < 0.4: Check VecNormalize stats
- Win rates stuck: Model might be in local minimum
- Rewards decreasing: STOP, run debugger again

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **MOST LIKELY REMAINING ISSUES**

Even with all fixes, you might still have problems if:

### Issue A: Environment Observations Not Informative
**Symptom**: Random policy performs as well as trained policy
**Test**: Debug script shows constant observation features
**Fix**: Need to improve observation space design

### Issue B: Opponents Too Hard/Easy
**Symptom**: Win rates stuck at 0% or 100% for specific opponents
**Test**: Debug script opponent difficulty analysis
**Fix**: Adjust opponent behavior or add intermediate difficulty

### Issue C: Reward Components Imbalanced
**Symptom**: Model optimizes one thing (e.g., damage) ignoring others
**Test**: Check reward component breakdown in debug output
**Fix**: Rebalance reward weights

### Issue D: LSTM States Leaking Across Episodes
**Symptom**: Explained variance <0, value predictions nonsensical
**Test**: Check if dones are properly signaled
**Fix**: Verify RecurrentPPO gets correct episode boundaries

## üéØ **FINAL CHECKLIST**

Before starting training, verify:

- [x] Fixed: `clip_reward=150.0` (not 10.0)
- [x] Fixed: Agent `get_env_info()` called
- [x] Fixed: Damage reward formula
- [x] Added: Normalization warmup
- [x] Added: Self-play curriculum
- [x] Increased: Entropy coefficient
- [x] Increased: Win reward
- [x] Relaxed: Policy update constraints
- [x] Created: Debug script
- [x] Created: Troubleshooting guide

**All critical bugs are now fixed in train_simplified_OPTIMIZED.py!**

---

## üìû **IF MODEL STILL NOT LEARNING**

1. **Run debugger**: `python user/debug_training.py > debug_log.txt`
2. **Review debug_log.txt**: Look for ‚ùå and ‚ö†Ô∏è
3. **Check [WHY_NOT_LEARNING.md](WHY_NOT_LEARNING.md)**: Match symptoms to root causes
4. **Test minimal agent**: Can it beat ConstantAgent? (Should be 90%+ in 50k steps)
5. **Monitor VecNormalize stats**: Print `vec_env.ret_rms.mean/var` during training

The model SHOULD learn now. The clip_reward bug alone was probably killing your training.

Good luck! üöÄ
